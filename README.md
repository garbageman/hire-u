## Long term goals:
* What is going to set this website apart from other sites?
* - We can do research in automated account removal. How can we distinguish unique users? How do we know if a user is not just another
user that under another name?

## TODO
### If you plan on doing a task, initial it and then when it is done add the date that it was finished
### Feel free to add anything to this list if you think it's important
### These tasks are in no particular order
* Add installation/setup directions for people new to the project
* Add a git best practices (or at least enough practices to not have problems) DN 12/30/15
* Add directions for development on different parts of the project. Hopefully we have a realtime HTML/CSS development framework set up for people that want to work on the front end.
* Create a model front end page that will be the template for all of the front end development. (Have a controller and services script coupled with some HTML)
* Create a model JDBC/Spring REST endpoint so that it can be used as a template for the rest of development
* Create a relational diagram or something to help figure out what we want the db to look like
* Set up Postgres so that we can start using it for test data and relations
* Set up REST services (Using Spring) http://spring.io/projects
* Set up security for user authentication using Spring as well
* Look into JDBC to hook the REST services into Postgres
