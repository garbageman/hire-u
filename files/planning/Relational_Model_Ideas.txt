Relational Model Planning

Things we need to keep track of/save:
Job Reviews
Jobs
Departments
Users (Employers and Job Seekers)
Job Postings

How do we represent each of the entities?
Job Reviews:
Username

Job Type / Department

Time Commitment/Flexibility

We should save the time of each review so you can see the trends in what
the working conditions are like. Also so you can filter to see the most recent
reviews.
