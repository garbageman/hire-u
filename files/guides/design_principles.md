# Design Principles
### Feel free to add ideas so that everyone is on the same page when it comes to design
### It is really important that the site feels like one whole application instead of a bunch of pages pasted together.

For this site we are going to be using mobile first design.
That is, when designing your webpages and services, think about how it
will look or work on a mobile device.
Even though there might not be mobile devices using our site (which is highly unlikely),
thinking mobile first forces you to limit the number of things you want to put on
your page. It makes your approach more minimalistic and makes it so that you only
add the most important features to your page and don't get caught up trying to
fill all the white space that is given to you by a normal 1920x1080 screen.
